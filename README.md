## Chapter 1 Day 1

1. What is a blockchain in own words?
A blockchain is a public database that stores information that everyone can see.  Anyone can interact with it and no one owns it.  Information on the blockchain is difficult or impossible to change or hack making it very secure.  Information is added to the chain in chronological order and creates a ledger style record.

2. Explain a smart contract
A smart contract is a set of rules or guidelines that developers create for users to interact with the blockchain.  They are fast, accurate, require no paperwork, and are extremely secure.  It might not make sense or be totally correct but I'm a gamer so I think about it like this.  If the console is the blockchain, the smart contracts are the games I use to interact and play with the system.  

3. Transaction vs Script
A transaction is a function that changes the data on the blockchain.  It is usually the only way to change the data.  Transactions can have a cost associated with it.  Scripts are ways to just view data on the chain.  They are free and do not change anything.

## Chapter 1 Day 2
1. The 5 pillars of cadence are safety and security, clairty, approachability, developer experience, and resource oriented programming.

2. The pillars are important because they speak to people who may not be familiar or experienced in this space.  Coding or learning about blockchains can be itimidating for many.  By building something that has pillars focused on secrutiy, safety, and approachability it appears less intimidating to people like me with no history in coding.  Transparency and a good user experience for developers are something that are appealing to people looking to get involved.
