1. What is a blockchain in own words?
A blockchain is a public database that stores information that everyone can see.  Anyone can interact with it and no one owns it.  Information on the blockchain is difficult or impossible to change or hack making it very secure.  Information is added to the chain in chronological order and creates a ledger style record.

2. Explain a smart contract
A smart contract is a set of rules or guidelines that developers create for users to interact with the blockchain.  They are fast, accurate, require no paperwork, and are extremely secure.  It might not make sense or be totally correct but I'm a gamer so I think about it like this.  If the console is the blockchain, the smart contracts are the games I use to interact and play with the system.  

3. Transaction vs Script
A transaction is a function that changes the data on the blockchain.  It is usually the only way to change the data.  Transactions can have a cost associated with it.  Scripts are ways to just view data on the chain.  They are free and do not change anything.
